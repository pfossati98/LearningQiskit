# LearningQiskit

My idea is to make a personal quantum device. This started as making a quantum coin flip in a hand held box... but I don't think I quite understand what I'm rtying to do. Branching off the Stern-Gerlach experiment, where you can divide electrons by their spin, and make a polarization measurement, how does one achieve the polarization? How do you write to a qubit? How do you store information in one and read it out at a later time? What functions can be made from it?

What would a quantum video game look like? Can we make quantum pixels? Does machine learning work with quantum computing?

All things I hope to figure out. Wish me good luck
